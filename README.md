# imagepixel
A simple python program that reconstruct an image using other images as pixels for the original image.

There are six different images named from 1.png to 6.png. Images are meant to be sorted from light to dark. The very first image has only one dot (thus lightest) and the lates is the one with six dots (darkest).
Feel free to change the images as you wish.

Granularity of the image will be determined by chunklen which is set to 5 by default.
